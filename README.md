20 newsgroups classification using naive bayes algorithm
The use of the tfidf vectoriizer unlike the conventional vectorizer helps select features from the large text files automatically, this is not the case with convertional counters.
The use of pipelines have been implemented to simplify the code for the test set
pipelines are a wrapping class developed by sklearn to wrap a series of transformers and estimators into one function which can be called easily without writing an explicit code.
finally, naive bayes has been used to classify the text.
